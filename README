To use simply

require "WildCard"
include WildCard


This does the heavy lifting for fancy method_missing calls so you write things like this

def say_X_Doug(phrase)
 "Doug says #{phrase}"
end

say_hello_Doug => "Doug says hello"
say_bye_Doug => "Doug says bye"

you can have multiple wildcards

def the_X_stole_my_X(animal,possession)
  "The #{animal} stole my fracking #{possession}"
end

the_dog_stole_my_laptop => "The dog stole my fracking laptop"

you can have regular params as well

def math_X_plus_X_equals(a,b,sum)
  a.to_i + b.to_i == sum
end

math_2_plus_3_equals(5) => true
math_2_plus_2_equals(5) => false

if you do anything like this
def i_want_X_and_X
  "you are spoiled"
end
dont do this
i_want_and_and_and => "bad things"

Have fun and please only use this in logical places
